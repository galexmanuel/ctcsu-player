From 01 June 2009:
Parsing Bugs:
	- Not saving data in the end of audio files
		+ KH: reports doesn't occur if audio file is local to machine
	- Button clicks not registering (GUI)
	- Auto-end to parses
		+ perhaps set a final value at 1 less than total bytes?
	- Add a save button that pauses the audio saves the data,
		then restarts the audio.

Coding Bugs:
	- Data Lost after manually editing the text file
	- Put a version number, or create a backup file for each text file.
	- Replay should do this: | # | -
							  <-----x
	- Variable speed (1 fast - 1 slow)
	- Volume default at 5
	- Have stream check GUI when resuming or replaying an audio file
		+ currently resets to stream defaults
	- Remove Tool Tips

From Whiteboard notes:
From 17 March 2009:
1 - Bug where codes lost, may be related to using currentUtterance in coding.
2 - killLastUtterance() feature requested
3 - "No Code" button
4 - Replay more on short utterances (less than a second)
- Bug where resume fails if last utterance not closed with an end parse call
- Edit template
	+ CD track controls
	+ Replay Button
		+ parserTemplate -> back 10 secs
		+ codingTemplate -> back 1 utterance
- Save progress to file button
	+ dialog to save on close?
	+ make it harder to not write out to file
		+ create more opportunities to write to file (pause, or other method call, etc.)
- Global Slider Listeners and Handlers


From 9/3/2008:

- Update Misc Utterance display functions
	+ update handled in thread with invokeLater()
	+ would this also have the time display code for the player?
- New code button handlers and listeners
- Other Misc code button handlers
- Fraction timecode into smaller units
- Invoke listeners in a thread?
- Build Edit template
	+ with CD-type track controls to skip through utterances
- Build the Global ratings template
	+ with snap-to-tick sliders (1, 5, default 3)
- Save progress to file button to back up progress while working
	+ perhaps save to a temp buffer file, or
	+ change change I/O implementation to handle this


August 26, 2008:

pokeTimer() ->
setTimeDisplay()
	-> update the player's time display
	-> updateMiscDisplay()
		-> if( time == nextUtteranceStart ){
				changeUtternace();
			}

- Save endtime on end of file or close
	+ dialog to remind to save before closing

- Invoke Listeners in separate threads?	

- Have each template have its own player contro0ls?

- Replay Button - 
	+ go back through queue and reset template and player to that point
		+does this erase what's in the queue?

- Edit or Review utterance feature
	+ review buttons for editing and skipping through utterances
		+ skip to the next utterance like a CD track button 
		
- How to split timecode into smaller than one second chunks
	on logical sound boundaries?
		+ 1/4 seconds?
		+ 1/10 seconds?
		+ test these for accurate tracking
		+ update TimeCode class and calls to handle this
