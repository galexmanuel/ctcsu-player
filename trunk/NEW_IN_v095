New in this version (v0.9.5):
June 2009

- Added Request: Button mouse-over tool-tips removed.
- Added Request: Volume default set at 5
- Fixed bug where player ignored user's volume setting when 
	resuming play.
- Fixed bug where audio stutters initially on resume play after pause.
- Added Request: Added a "Backup" button.
	If Backup Button is pressed while player is playing or paused,
	it will pause the audio if needed,
	write all of the current data out to a text file,
	reload the current data into memory,
	then alert the user that the operation is complete.
- Added Request: Pressing Stop or the Window X-button 
	will end an active parse, then save the data to file.
	This provides closing data to the last parse rather than null.
- Multiple fixes and changes made to address performance issues
	such as, mouse clicks not responding.
	+ While the user facing portion of the application remains
	almost identical.  Major architectural changes have been made
	under the surface to:
	- increase efficient memory usage,
	- allow for better modularity (so new coding methods can be added),
	- increase GUI responsiveness
	- increase maintainability, and facilitate fixes and changes
	- address and improve overall multi-threading performance

Remaining to fix before release:
- Fix Replay button performance during coding.
- Complete writing Backup feature, so that it writes to a separate file.
